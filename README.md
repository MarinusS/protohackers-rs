# Protohackers-rs
This repo contains my solutions the [Protohackers Server programming challenge](https://protohackers.com/), using Rust. \
Players are encouraged to share their solutions and links can be found on the leaderboard.

## Disclaimer
This code was produced while I was still learning rust, therefore it probably is not optimal nor idiomatic.

## Running the code
The run the code correponding to a given problem simply run `cargo run --bin problem_X` where `X` is the number of the problem. \
Install instructions for the rust toolchain can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
